**Why is this so important?**

My home country has been ruined by terrible war started by Russian Federation.
Thousands of people lost their lives and homes. Millions are affected by acts of terrorism,
which occur on daily basis. They say they came to protect someone, but instead cruelly kill
children and elderly people, erase whole cities from the face of the earth, because they simply don't
want Ukraine to exist. This is insane to have such reality in the 21st century,
so we must stop the global evil from expanding. Arm Ukraine - give this world a chance!
